A C++/Objective-C++ library for reading/writing XML files.
Like boost libraries, this is just an assembly of header files,
so that users do not have to compile them in advance.
#C++ case
It requires Xerces-C++ library.
To utilize, add XMLUtility to include path (-I/WhereYouInstalled),
and write
#include "XMLLoader.hpp"
in your code.

#Objective-C++ case
It just requires a MacOS environment (and Xcode).
To utilize in Xcode, add "/WhereYouInstalled" to "User header path" in project settings,
and write
#define XMLUTILITIES_NSXMLPARSER
#include "XMLLoader.hpp"
in your code.

There is a sample program "main_example.cpp".
To run this,
$ export XERCESDIR=???	# Where you installed xerces
$ g++ main_example.cpp -I/$XERCESDIR/include -L/$XERCESDIR/lib -lxerces-c -o main_example
