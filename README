A C++/Objective-C++ library for reading/writing XML files.
Like boost libraries, this is just an assembly of header files,
so that users do not have to compile them in advance.

Requirements:
#Necessary
xerces-c++ library
http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/
	or
MacOS environment

#Only for utility and sample programs
GNU readline


Usage:
In both cases below, "-I/(XMLUTILITIES_PATH)/include" flag is necessary when you build your sources.
#C++ case
It requires Xerces-C++ library.
To utilize, add XMLUtility to include path (-I/WhereYouInstalled),
and write
#include "XMLLoader.hpp"
in your code.
When you build your programs, please add an include flag and linker flags like
	...
	CXXFLAGS += -I/$(XERCESDIR)/include -I/(XMLUTILITIES_PATH)/include
	LDFLAGS += -L/$(XERCESDIR)/lib -lxerces-c
	...
	g++ ~~ $(CXXFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) ~~

#Objective-C++ case
It just requires a MacOS environment (and Xcode).
To utilize in Xcode, add "/WhereYouInstalled" to "User header path" in project settings,
and write
#define XMLUTILITIES_NSXMLPARSER
#include "XMLLoader.hpp"
in your code.
As mentioned above, add "-I/(XMLUTILITIES_PATH)/include" flag manually
or in Xcode preferences.



Utility and sample programs:
A sample program "main_example.cpp" is in src directory.
To build this,
$ export XERCESDIR=??	# Where you installed xerces
$ g++ main_example.cpp -I/$XERCESDIR/include -L/$XERCESDIR/lib -lxerces-c -o main_example
or type 'make' as followings.

Utility programs are also in src directory.
To build and install these (including main_example.cpp),
$ export XERCESDIR=??	# Where you installed xerces
$ export READLINEDIR=??	# Where you installed xerces
$ g++ main_example.cpp -I/$XERCESDIR/include -L/$XERCESDIR/lib -lxerces-c -o main_example
